the image of sample email is attached
when checking the email address it was clear that it was different from citi bank official customer mail.
it was clear case of spoofing 
further i checked header it was also a sign of spoofing
now i checked the link 
the link was https://secure.citibank-verification.com
but the real bank link will end as .citibank.com not verification.com
there werent any grammar or speeling mistake but there was error like
it stated your account rather than name plus
Phrases like “suspicious activity” and “confirm your identity” are classic phishing red flags
quick summary of phishing traits in this email:
Suspicious Sender Address
Support@Citibanksecuremygateway.com is not an official Citibank domain.
Urgent / Fear Tactic
Subject: “Suspicious Activity” creates panic to force quick action.
Suspicious Link
https://secure.citibank-verification.com looks like Citibank but is actually a fake domain.
Generic Greeting / Message
No personal name, just “your account”. Legit banks usually address you directly.
Vague Content
Doesn’t explain what the suspicious activity is.
